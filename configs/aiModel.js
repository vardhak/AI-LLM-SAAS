It\'s remarkably uniform with small temperature fluctuations which correspond to variations in the early universe\'s density. 2) Redshift: The light from distant galaxies is shifted towards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. This redshift is interpreted as the galaxies moving away from us, with the speed increasing with distance.
